# Barnsley Fern Generator

This project implements a Barnsley Fern fractal generator using C# and WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation).
The Barnsley Fern is a fascinating fractal that exhibits self-similarity and is created through a mathematical algorithm. 
The `BarnsleyFern` class defines the logic for generating the fern, and the `MainWindow` class provides a simple WPF interface to customize the fern's appearance.
The application initializes with default values, and users can interactively adjust the size, reduction factor, and turn bias using sliders. 
Clicking the "Generate Fern" button redraws the fern on the canvas based on the selected parameters. 
This project serves as a fun and educational tool for exploring fractals and the Barnsley Fern in particular.
